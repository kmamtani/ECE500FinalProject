This is a paper regarding the re-implementation and exploration of the Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation using Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks paper by Jun-Yan Zhu. The cycleGAN is trained to convert an image of a horse to an image of a zebra and vice versa. The model does not have access to paired data and instead uses a discriminator and a generator to make the conversion form A to B as well as from B to A.
